# Autonomous Vehicle Perception System

This repository contains a C++ project that simulates an autonomous vehicle's perception system by fusing sensor data from radar and camera sources and making safe driving decisions. It reads sensor data from text files, fuses the data based on matching object IDs, and outputs both the fused data and a decision log.

## Features

- **Data Acquisition:**  
  Reads simulated radar data (`radar_data.txt`) and camera data (`camera_data.txt`) from text files.

- **Sensor Fusion:**  
  Combines the radar and camera data into a unified structure based on object IDs.

- **Decision Making:**  
  Applies defined thresholds (distance and confidence) to determine whether to send a braking command or continue along the path.

- **Logging:**  
  Outputs fused data and driving decisions to the console and logs the decisions to `perception_log.txt`.

- **Object-Oriented Design:**  
  Demonstrates basic usage of classes and objects by encapsulating functionality within the `PerceptionSystem` class.

## File Structure

- **main.cpp**: The main C++ source file containing the project code.version 4
- **radar_data.txt**: A sample text file that contains the simulated radar sensor data.
- **camera_data.txt**: A sample text file that contains the simulated camera sensor data.
- **perception_log.txt**: The output log file generated by the program.
- **radar_camera_file_creation.cpp**: C++ source file to develop sample radar and camera txt files.
- **README.md**: This file.

## Requirements

- A C++ compiler (e.g., g++ or Visual Studio).
- Standard C++ libraries (`<iostream>`, `<fstream>`, `<iomanip>`, `<cstring>`, `<algorithm>`,`<random>`,`<ctime>`, etc.).


## How to Build and Run

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bmhall455/Portfolio.git
   cd your-repository-name
   g++ -o createFiles radar_camera_file_creation.cpp
    ./createFiles
   g++ -o PerceptionSystem main.cpp
   ./PerceptionSystem

---

These steps ensure that anyone cloning your repository can first generate the sensor data files and then build and run the main perception system program. Adjust file names and compiler commands as needed for your environment.
